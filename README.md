# Task 7 – Basic Sales Summary

## What I Did
This task was about getting a quick sales summary from a small SQLite database using Python.

Here’s what I did:
- Created a database (sales_data.db) with a simple sales table.
- Added some example data (like apples, bananas, and oranges).
- Wrote a SQL query to get total quantity sold and total revenue for each product.
- Used pandas to load the data and matplotlib to make a bar chart.

## Tools I Used
- Python
- sqlite3
- pandas
- matplotlib

## What You’ll See
- Printed sales summary in the terminal.
- A bar chart showing revenue by product (saved as sales_chart.png).
